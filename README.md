## Description

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

Desksides is a digital connection hub that helps brands get noticed. Desksides introduces brands to journalists for a fraction of the price of a typical public relations firm, with a fraction of the headache. Desksides is publicity without the publicist. 

Brands and journalists can register accounts with Desksides by providing information on their background and their goals. This information gives the Desksides administrator everything they need to know to expertly pair brands and journalists with aligned interests. 

Once matches have been made, the Desksides platform facilitates communication, file sharing and scheduling between the brands and journalist, providing a more efficient method of conducting deskside meetings.

## Getting Started

Ensure that the prerequisites are installed and then follow the steps in the installation process.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) optional

### Installation

1. Create a database named `desksides`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

Brands
1. Brand users can create an account by clicking the 'get started' button and filling out some basic information.
2. Once the user's account has been approved by an admin, they may return to Desksides to complete their brand assessment.
3. After filling out the assessment, the user is brought to the user dashboard. From the dashboard, the user can access their Calendly account, email Desksides, access any brand assets linked to their account, update their profile or view a list of journalists that Desksides has matched them with. 
4. The matches view displays journalist that Desksides has carefully selected to pair with the user's brand. From this view, the user can schedule a meeting with, send an email to, or share files with any of their matched journalists.

Journalists
1. Journalist users can create an account by clicking the 'get started' button and filling out some basic information.
2. Journalists will then be immediately brought to the journalist assessment view, where they with provide Desksides with information on their background and credentials.
3. At this point, the Journalist user has completed all necessary tasks and can wait to hear from Desksides or one of their brand users to schedule meetings.
